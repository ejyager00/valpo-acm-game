**Is there anything not working??** -- Currently there are more things working than not working, a short todo list would be
something like this though:

- [ ]  have music running in the background
- [ ]  have enemies rotate their angle while they move to look more natural
- [ ]  have different types of enemies (bosses)
- [ ]  add a gif of the gameplay after we add the above features
